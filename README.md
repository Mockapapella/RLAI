# Rocket Python

Ideas from notes:

- Start with GAN to replicate an actual image
- Use those generated GAN images to stuff the training data until it has an equivalent of 60FPS
- Tokenize an image
  - Learn how tokenizers work
- [Frame, buttons pressed, timestamp]
- Use some sort of generator network to "dream" about what actions it should take until the next check in with reality
  - Would have to be based on the previous set of "x" frames to enforce continuity
  - Pull concepts from language models
  - Transformers
